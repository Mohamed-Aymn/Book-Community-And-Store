# Book Community & Store

> An experimental website that is made to go through the entire journey to develop a full-stack web project, from planning strategies, and choosing suitable techs and packages to an established website that is capable of building specific features over to be ready for commercial use.

## Detaild description

Technologies and packages are chosen carefully after case studies as mentioned above to be able to reach the project's aim which is performance-optimized web store‚ö° with an attractive user interface to make it fun and cool for users to enjoy their time using it!!! üòÄ Development journey is the main aim behind this project so there wasn't a specific or professional UI UX design for my project to follow and the design implemented design is inspired by official professional websites and designs.

### Used technologies

> A brief for the most important technologies is typed to explain the reason behind choosing them.

-   #### **Framework**

    -   NextJs

    NextJs is chosen rather than normal react app due to the IMPORTANT need for server side rendered application due to online store purposes

-   #### **State managment**

    -   React Query

    React query is a perfect choice for the server-side state, especially for this project as in many scenarios this project will depend on states that depend on async functions and fetching details such as main search query and all user states that will be fetched from the backend.üì¨

    -   Zustand

    As a project that will do several huge functions (e-commerce & social application), there will be a huge need for a well-organized client state management, so the best choice for this need is to separate the application's state into several stores that are well organized in a place that outside reacts components üß∞‚Ää, Zustand is a very good fit for this project as it provides all that need in a simple and smart React way which is hooks!

-   #### **Styilng**

    -   styled-components

    Implementation of a repetitive design system for a scalable website with a framework (React) that depends mainly on breaking UI into components and using an atomic design system ‚öõÔ∏è‚Ää will require a choice that supports styled-components pattern which is the trending solution nowadays, and guess what! the most suitable choice for this scenario is the styled-components package, also it will make me able to use the power javascript (jsx files) with styling to support transition and several cases!

    -   react-transition-group

    when it comes to component mount and unmount transitions ‚ñ∂Ô∏è, a smart and light-width bundled solution is needed to solve this challenge to be integrated with styled-components that are developed with styled-components library and use the power of JavaScript (jsx files) with styling.

    -   react-intersection-observer

-   #### **Forms**

    -   React form hook

    After putting in my mind the main aim for this project which is to implement a performance-optimized website ‚ö°‚Ääand cool to interact with‚ÄäüòÄ‚Ää, React form hook supports this aim perfectly as it will handle uncontrolled forms (without declaring extra state) as will help me achieve the lowest number of component re-rendering. üîÑ

-   #### **Authentication**
    -   NextAuth (Auth.js)
-   #### **Database**
    -   mongodb (mongoose)
